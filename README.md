Address Book
Follow along with the Address Book lessons to add the new concepts discussed in last night's homework. Complete these items for it too:

Add functionality to record and display a contact's email address.
Add functionality to record and display a contact's physical address.
Then, add functionality that allows a user to record multiple addresses (email or physical) for a single Contact, and what type each address is (ie: "work", "personal", etc.) (Hint: Address will need to be an object with multiple properties saved within the Contact object.)
Remove any additional address fields when the form is submitted. (One way to do this would be to use the not() and remove() functions.)
If you wish, work on these too:

Refactor some of the other sections of the jQuery into more modular functions
Try a jQuery method from either the CSS or Effects options in the documentation (e.g. fadeIn() or css())
Try a jQuery method from the Events options (e.g. hover() or keypress())
Add support for multiple AddressBooks, each with their own unique set of Contacts. (For instance, you could have School, Personal, and Work address books to organize different types of friends, co-workers, and acquaintances.)
